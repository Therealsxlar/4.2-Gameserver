## Note
> This gameserver is unfinshed and is planned to be worked on. (message me on discord if i should keep working on this) **star it aswell**
- I do this to help people, if you ever want to get into C++ just in general or even learn how a Game-Server works.
- If your learning C++ feel free to add or test things with this Game-Server it's all experimental.
